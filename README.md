## Election-Audit Summary
Using Python 3.7 software, a code was created to read a csv file of the election results.  This Python code can be used with for other election audits with minor modifications to the code. Depending on the amount of data provided in the election results file, this can code can be modified to calculate voter turn-out if there is data for number of registered voters per county.  If demographics are included in the data, several calculations can be added in the code to calculate the percentage of votes per demographic.
